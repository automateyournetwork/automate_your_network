I believe in open source software. I believe people should have universal access to Linux. I believe open source tools like Ansible should remain open source. 

While I am no longer much of an advocate for Ansible and have evolved my approach to use pyATS for network automation I still believe in my book and think it can help you start your journey into the world of network automation. 

Please enjoy.
